        <p>To hide a branch, mouse over that branch, and you will see the eye <i class='fa fa-eye icon-green'></i> icon appear to the left of the branch name; click this to hide.

        Or perform this task by right-clicking the branch and selecting `Hide`.</p>

        <h3>Solo</h3>
        <p>Soloing a branch will hide all other branches which have not been soloed, showing <i>only</i> soloed branches.</p>
        <p>To solo a branch, right-click the branch and select `Solo`. This initiates Solo Mode, with soloed branches highlighted in orange and with a solid orange <i class='fa fa-dot-circle-o icon-orange'></i> icon to the left of the branch name.</p>
        <p>Solo/unsolo additional branches by clicking on the semi-opaque icon to the left of that branch's name.</p>
        <p>Consider hiding/soloing entire remotes if you only need about two remotes, and then hiding everything else.</p>
