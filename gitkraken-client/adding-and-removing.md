Add a file to GitKraken Client using the Command Palette.

Folders can be created while creating a file by including a "/" in the file name.

## Filter files

If you tick the `View all files` option, you'll gain access to the <kbd>Filter Files</kbd> bar. Use this to quickly jump to a specific file or to filter by a file type.
