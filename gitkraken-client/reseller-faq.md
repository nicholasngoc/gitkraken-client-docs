### Can I pay with a Purchase Order?

We only accept credit card payments, PayPal and bank order.

### I will pay using a credit card, but I need the credit card details removed after purchase.

Please email <accounting@gitkraken.com> with any request to manually remove billing details from an account. We typically fulfill these requests within 1 business day.

### I just purchased. Where is my key? Shouldn't I get emailed a license?

While GitKraken Client is a downloadable application, there is no key for your account. All licenses are managed from [https://app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/). Additionally, any users you add to your account will be emailed a link to activate their account automatically.

### Are licenses transferable to other users?

Yes. You can reallocate a license to a different user at any time by [managing your subscription](/account/organizations).

### Can I use my GitKraken Pro license on more than one computer?

Yes, your GitKraken Pro paid subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitKraken Pro on as many computers as you'd like!
