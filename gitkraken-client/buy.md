## 1. Create an account
If you are purchasing a GitKraken product, first [create an account](https://app.gitkraken.com/register).

If you are buying the subscription on behalf of an organization, don't worry. Gitkraken allows you to hand over the ownership of the account to another user.


<div class='callout callout--danger'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Check your email to verify your account registration. You will not be able to manage your organization until this step is complete.</p>
</div>

## 2. Choose a plan

After account creation, choose your plan. Select the corresponding <button class='button button--primary button--ui button--nolink'><span style='color:#141422;'>Purchase License</span></button> tab to choose your plan. You may select _full pricing options_ to see all options available.

If you need to come back to this page later, navigate directly to [https://app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com), or click _Manage Account_ from the user menu dropdown in-app when ready.

<img src="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/licenses-page.png" srcset="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/licenses-page@2x.png 2x" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Each user will need a GitKraken Client license, here is how to bestow a license:

### Allocating licenses
1. Under <em class="context-menu">Organization  <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> [Your organization name]</em> , click <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add User</button>
2. Enter the user email address
3. Select the user role
4. Click <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add user</button>
5. Celebrate

If users are new to GitKraken, they will receive an email invitation with a link to activate their account.

Once the license is allocated, make sure the user is logging into the app with the email address listed in the Pro organization.

If a user does not see the red Pro icon in the bottom right, have them [login again](/account/login).

Additionally, you can set up a user as a <kbd>Billing Contact (unlicensed)</kbd>. This is perfect for people who don't need to use GitKraken Client, but wish to have access to manage the account subscription and settings.
