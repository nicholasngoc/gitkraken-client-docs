You've installed the app; fantastic! Now to login with your account.

***

Alternatively, navigate to <kbd><i>File    <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>     Sign into a Different Account</i></kbd>

If you're logging into GitKraken using another account such as [GitHub](/integrations/github#sign-in-with-github), select the GitHub option to authenticate.

If you don't have `GitKraken` yet, [register](https://app.gitkraken.com/register) your account today. Or if you need to manage your paid subscription, click to [manage subscription](https://app.gitkraken.com/register).

## Sign in with GitHub or Google

When navigating to <em class='context-menu'><i class="fa fa-bars"> </i>  <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign into a different account</em>, you may choose to sign in with GitHub or Google:

<img src='/img/documentation/managing-organizations/login/sign-in.png' srcset='/img/documentation/managing-organizations/login/sign-in@2x.png 2x' class='img-bordered img-responsive center'>

Should you choose GitHub, this will open your default browser and authenticate your account with GitHub. If you are already signed into GitHub on your browser, GitKraken Client will sign you in using that GitHub account.

If you choose Google, GitKraken Client will open a new browser window. Select the Google account you wish to connect, and then GitKraken Client will finish the authentication. 

If however GitKraken Client does not automatically log you in after signing in with Google, you may manually enter the Oauth token provided on the success page that appears after you sign into Google, to complete the authentication.

<img src='/img/documentation/managing-organizations/login/google-token.png' srcset='/img/documentation/managing-organizations/login/google-token@2x.png 2x' class='img-bordered img-responsive center'>

Additionally if your Google account has a GitKraken account associated, the app will automatically link the accounts together.

## FAQ

### Can I use my GitKraken Pro license on more than one computer?

Yes, your GitKraken Pro paid subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitKraken Pro on as many computers as you'd like!

###I just subscribed but I do not see PRO in the lower right corner.

Be sure you are logged in with the same email address registered with your GitKraken Pro subscription. You can check by navigating to <em class='context-menu'><i class="fa fa-bars"> </i>  <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign into a different account</em>, and then verify that your email is correct.
