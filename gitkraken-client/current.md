_We want to help teams cut out all the jibber-jabber when working with pull requests across multiple repos. Get ready for GirKraken Client v8.4, a release that will have you saying "I love it when a pull request comes together."_

### New ‚ú®
_I pity the tool that does not have Workspaces or the GitKraken CLI._


- GitKraken Workspaces:
    - Workspaces now include a Pull Requests view!
        - Users can filter PRs to see items "Assigned to me".
        - At-risk pull requests are highlighted through a label and filterable.
        - Selecting any GitHub pull request now shows the user a new Pull Request view that presents users options to quickly manage PRs across a whole Workspace.
    - Clicking on any repo in a Workspace now shows see more info and options. Users will see the repository's README, as well as quick access buttons to open the repository in a Repo Tab, Terminal Tab, or on the remote repository's hosting provider.


- GitKraken CLI:
    - The <kbd>Terminal</kbd> button in a Repo Tab‚Äôs toolbar will now open the GitKraken CLI inside a Terminal Panel, instead of opening a new Terminal Tab. Users can still open new Terminal Tabs through a New Tab, the Command Palette, or through any Terminal‚Äôs context menu.
    - Users can toggle the Terminal Panel on and off by pressing the Terminal button in Repo Tab toolbar, through keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+`</kbd>, the Command Palette, the Terminal Panel‚Äôs context menu, or options in the GitKraken Client's View menu. Toggling the Terminal Panel will turn it on or off across all Repo Tabs.
    - A Terminal Panel session can also be terminated by executing the `exit` command. This will only close the Terminal Panel and not the Repo Tab. Toggling the Terminal Panel back on will initialize a new terminal session. 
    - Unlike with the Terminal Tabs, navigating to a different working directory in a Terminal Panel will not change the repository opened in the Repo Tab.
    - The following `gk` commands are available in the Terminal Panel:
	    - `gk blame`
	    - `gk diff`
	    - `gk history`
	    - `gk help`

### Improvements üôå
_Making GitKraken Client a mean, clean Git managing machine._

- Users will now see helpful icons when shown GitKraken CLI Autocomplete suggestions, helping clarify to which command the suggestion is related.
- Git LFS users will see improved performance checkouts. 

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_Shut up, bugs!_

- Filtering Autocomplete suggestions by name will work as expected.
- After selecting between multiple Autocomplete suggestions that have the same prefix, further suggestions will disappear as expected.
- Users will no longer be allowed to create Workspaces for repositories on unsupported versions of GitLab Self-Managed services.
- Bitbucket Server users will now see the branches correctly populated when creating Pull Requests.

_Get ready for a multiverse bending reveal!  We are unleashing the cosmic power of GitKraken Workspaces with the release of GitKraken Client v8.2!_

### New ‚ú®
_We have helped users progress and seen them accomplish wonders._

#### Introducing GitKraken Workspaces

GitKraken Workspaces save teams time by providing an easy way to group repositories, take actions against multiple repositories at once, and quickly onboard new team members. 

GitKraken Workspaces allow you to gather and access all the required repos for your project in a single tab in GitKraken Client. The new GitKraken Workspaces tab shows you the status for the last branch that you checked out, how far ahead and/or behind in commits you are, and if there is an active WIP for each included repository. 

GitKraken Workspaces can be created as Personal, only visible to you, or Shared, visible to all members of your Organization.  

 - Users can access GitKraken Workspaces from the new ‚ÄúWorkspaces‚Äù tab in the tabs bar, from the New Tab view, from the command palette, which can be opened with the keyboard shortcut <kbd>cmd/ctrl + p</kbd>, or from the newly added repository breadcrumb in any Repo Tab.

- Users can view details and trigger the following actions on any or all of the repositories in a workspace at once:
    - Clone multiple repositories at once. This will help teams quickly onboard a new team member or get a new computer up and running.
    - View the last checked out branch for all repositories and see if a branch is ahead/behind a remote.
    - View work in progress for all repositories, including the number of files modified, added, renamed, or deleted. 
    - Perform a fetch for all or a selection of repositories.
    - Open multiple repos in GitKraken Client, or in an external editor, such as VS Code, IntelliJ, Atom, or Sublime Text.
    - Open any repository in the associated hosting service website.

- GitKraken Workspaces can currently contain repositories hosted on GitHub.com, GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org.

#### Themes:

- Users may now create their own custom GitKraken Client themes. 
    - For more information about creating a new custom theme, checkout our [Themes documentation](/start-here/themes/) or navigate to `gitkraken/themes/README.md`.

- Users will find two new themes when navigating to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>UI Customization</kbd> menu.

- Users can now sync their GitKraken theme with their system theme, if their OS supports it.

#### Activity status:

- An activity status will now display on the avatars of members in your GitKraken Organization or Team, indicating if they are actively using GitKraken Client. This activity status icon is visible in the Team View section in the Left Panel, or in the Organization view in Preferences.

- Users can manually set their status to ‚ÄúActive‚Äù or ‚ÄúAway‚Äù by selecting the circle icon in the top right corner, or by opening the <kbd>Profile/Account</kbd> dropdown menu.

GitKraken Workspaces and Activity status are currently unavailable for Self-Hosted and Stand-Alone customers. 

### Improvements üôå
_When you love something, you improve it._

- GitKraken CLI:
    - Users can now customize the behavior of the <kbd> ‚Üπ Tab</kbd> key when using auto-complete in a Terminal Tab. This setting can be found under <kbd> Preferences </kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Terminal</kbd>  ‚Üí <kbd> Tab Behavior</kbd>.
    - Users can customize the cursor used in a Terminal Tab. This can be configured in <kbd> Preferences </kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Terminal</kbd>  ‚Üí <kbd>Cursor Style</kbd>. Users can select either Block, Underline or Bar for their cursor.
    - Auto-complete suggestions will now show branches and tags as options when running `git diff` or `git reset` commands.
    - The `gk diff` command now supports tags and branches as options.
    - Auto-complete suggestions have been added for `npm` and `yarn`.

- When users open the pull request panel and click on a pull request while the left panel is minimized, GitKraken Client will now open the pull request view.

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_We came here years ago to protect users from these bugs._

- When using the GitKraken CLI, suggestions will disappear as expected after auto-completing a command with escaped characters in the path.

- After using GitKraken Client to execute a cherry-pick and resolving any arising conflicts, the Git CLI will no longer report that a cherry-pick is currently active.

- When creating a pull request in a repository with a large number of forks, users will no longer have to wait as all forks are being fetched before opening the dropdown menu.

## Version 8.0.0

### Tuesday, September 21st, 2021

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrjLwxsivLg?controls=1&modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

_"It began with the forging of the Great <del>Rings</del> Kraken."_

The true power of the Fellowship of developer collaboration is unleashed in GitKraken Client's v8.0!
### New ‚ú®

_‚ÄúOne tool to rule them all,_ <br>
_One tool to find them,_ <br>
_One tool to bring them all_ <br>
_and in the Git log bind them.‚Äù_

#### Introducing the GitKraken CLI Preview

The GitKraken CLI adds a Git-enhanced, keyboard-driven, terminal experience to GitKraken Client. Get the powerful Git visualizations GitKraken Client is known for‚Äîlike the commit graph‚Äîin the context of a Terminal Tab. Plus auto-suggest and auto-complete for Git commands to help you drive (and learn) Git faster, with fewer mistakes.

Dive deeper into file changes with the `gk` commands. Use the command `gk history` to see File History and `gk blame` to see what has changed in a file or commit and who made those changes. 

During the GitKraken CLI Preview we are looking for feedback to help improve this feature. Please use the `Feedback` form linked in the bottom right corner of your GitKraken Client app, or email us at feedback@gitkraken.com.


- Users can open Terminal Tabs in a number of ways:
    - Clicking the "New Terminal Tab" button after opening a New tab in GitKraken Client.
    - From the "Terminal" button in the toolbar of a Repo tab (opens the current repo in a Terminal Tab).
    - From the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + P</kbd>).
    - When working in a Terminal Tab, you can open a new Terminal Tab with the key combination <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + T</kbd>. The new Terminal Tab will open in the same working directory. 

- Auto-complete and auto-suggest make building Git commands easier than ever before in the GitKraken CLI. This feature works for users of PowerShell for Windows, ZSH and Bash for Mac/Linux. 
    - Auto-complete and auto-suggest are configured for the most common Git commands, but we are continuing to build out this feature and would love feedback on which commands and parameters you want added. 
    -  Please be aware that other auto-complete programs could potentially cause the GitKraken CLI auto-complete to stop working. You may need to uninstall or disable those other programs to use this feature.
    - Note: If you switch shells, you'll need to set the new shell as default in your operating system settings and restart your computer for auto-complete to continue working as expected.

- Some of the legendary Git visualizations that GitKraken Client is known for are also accessible within Terminal Tabs. To quickly view the commit graph, file diff, history, and blame view, simply type these commands:
    - `gk panel`: toggles the visualization panel on or off. You can also reposition the panel to the top, bottom, left, or right by adding those parameters to the command.  For example `gk panel right` moves the panel to the right of the screen. 
    - `gk graph`: shows the graph view. While this command has similar behavior to `gk panel`, even allowing repositioning of the graph with the same top, bottom, left, or right parameters, this command also returns to the graph if you're in a different view and has subcommands for toggling the graph columns with the keyboard.
    - `gk history` and `gk blame`: open the history or blame panel for a specified file.
    - `gk diff`: shows changes between commits. If no commit SHAs are provided, it will use your WIP and HEAD. If only one commit SHA is provided, it will be compared with HEAD.
    - `gk --help`: shows the list of available `gk` commands. You can also use --help on a specific `gk` command to see its arguments.
    - A toolbar above the panel will display the current repository name, branch, tag, and the number of changes pending to be pulled and/or pushed. Clicking this toolbar will toggle the panel on or off.
    - For Free accounts, this visualization panel will only be accessible within publicly-hosted repositories.

- A Terminal section has been added to the Preferences menu that allows Terminal Tab customization:
    - Font choice. Changes to this setting will only apply to new Terminal Tabs.
    - Font size.
    - Enable auto-complete & auto-suggest.
    - Default the visualization panel position when opening a new panel: top, right, bottom, or left.
    - Show the visualization panel by default. This will apply only when opening new tabs.
    - Terminal theme.

The GitKraken CLI Preview is currently unavailable for Self-Hosted and Stand-Alone customers. 
<br>
<br>
#### Deep Linking

_"Oh, it‚Äôs quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, click the link, and the doors will open."_

We've added the ability to share deep links to specific remote repositories, commits, branches, and tags in GitKraken Client. This allows users to more easily collaborate and save time when working in issue queues or Git pull requests.  

- When shared, these links will both open and focus GitKraken Client to the linked repository. The links will focus GitKraken Client on the commit, branch, or tag specified. When specifying a branch, the latest commit of that branch will be focused.
- The links can be found in GitKraken Client's context menus under `Copy link to remote/commit/branch/tag`.
<br>
<br>

#### Jira App Integration - Git Integration for Jira
_"It‚Äôs the Jira ticket that‚Äôs never started that takes the longest to finish."_

GitKraken Client now works with the Git Integration for Jira app to allow quick navigation between the client and Jira when viewing commits and file diffs related to Jira issues.

- In GitKraken Client, you‚Äôll find buttons and links to open the following in Git Integration for Jira:
    - File diffs - within the file diff view and in file context menus.
    - Commits - context menu when right-clicking commits in the graph.

- In the Git Integration for Jira, anywhere you view commits and diffs will automatically  have links to open them in GitKraken Client.

- To leverage GitKraken‚Äôs Git Integration for Jira integration you will need to:
    - Connect Jira Cloud Integration in the GitKraken Git Client.
    - Select Jira Cloud as the Issue Tracker for a repository.
    - Select a Jira Project.
    - Install Git Integration for Jira on the same Jira Cloud instance as the Jira Project.
### Improvements üôå
_"Even the smallest update can change the course of history."_


- The Fuzzy Finder is now the Command Palette! 
    - We've renamed the Fuzzy Finder to the Command Palette. You can still open the command palette through the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + P</kbd>, or through the new magic wand icon in the toolbar.
- Tab navigation has been significantly improved when many tabs are open at once.
    - We have improved the tooltips to provide both tab title and repo information.
    - Tooltips will now instantly appear when hovering the entire tab, not just the title.
    - A new dropdown list has been added to the tabs bar to help with tab navigation.
- Reopening tabs after a ‚Äúclose all tabs to the right‚Äù, a ‚Äúreopen closed tab‚Äù will now reopen only one tab at a time, instead of all that were closed at once.
-   An option to ‚ÄúQuote Reply‚Äù has been added for comments in the PR view.
- The profile menu now shows the Organization associated with the current profile.
- A ‚ÄúCancel Rebase‚Äù button has been added at the top right of the Interactive Rebase panel for easier access.
- We have improved form, prompt, and modal keyboard navigation and submission.
- Improved user experience for the login form.

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_"You (bugs) shall not pass!"_

- Styling of long branch names in the right panel has been improved.
- Users will no longer see issues for remotes without access to a repo, as happens when users leave an organization or when forks are deleted. 
- When using the delete key to erase spaces in a URL, the cursor will behave as expected. 
- The Pull Request icon has been added back to branch labels in the graph.
- The bottom of Diff views are no longer cut off when the file mode changes.
- Relative paths are now allowed in hooksPath.
- All users are now able to select a project for GitLab and GitLab-Self-Managed issues on the left panel.
- If Sublime Text 4 is installed, it will now be detected and appear in the external editor dropdown. 
- Debouncing has been added in the left panel search. Searches will be executed when you stop typing, instead of on each letter, making it easier to find what you‚Äôre looking for.
