<a id="v3-6-6"></a>
## Version 3.6.6
<h3>Thursday, July 12th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* Addresses the git vulnerabilities identified in [CVE-2018-10887](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10887) and [CVE-2018-10888](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10888).

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Windows users experiencing an `Assertion Failed!` error for `git_revwalk_hide` should no longer receive this error.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.6.6 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

## Version 3.6.4
<h3>Monday, June 18th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* There are never _too many_ places to add help instructions, so keyboard shortcuts are now accessible from the help menu.  
* Like a veteran camera man tracking a through ball, checking out a branch through the Fuzzy Finder will now scroll the branch into view. ‚öΩ
* GitLab.com users with private remote repositories will now display a placeholder icon instead of a blank box...a _keeper_, if you will.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Hopefully we've fixed this one for good!  Resolving merge conflicts on Windows should no longer result in the file getting CRLF line endings.
* On Windows, selecting <kbd>View all files</kbd> when viewing a commit diff should correctly display in Tree View.  Or, if you're watching Mexico play, El Tri view.  üá≤üáΩ
* Two World Cup games at the same time: awesome; two scroll bars at the same time: terrible.  Long commit messages will no longer have double scroll bars when viewing the diff of a file.
* Can you imagine if two goals by the same player canceled each other out?  A <kbd>Pull Request</kbd> with the same name as an existing <kbd>Pull Request</kbd> will now display, instead of appearing blank.
* Accurate passing is key to any match.  When opening a <kbd>Pull Request</kbd> in , using <kbd>Tab</kbd> will now jump to the next field instead of selecting users or labels from the dropdown menu.
* Pushing is grounds for a yellow card, so repositories with long names will no longer overflow in the repository bread-crumb menu.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
* Like a super sub fresh off the bench, Enterprise clients that are launched in an offline environment should load significantly faster.üèÉ

<a id="v3-6-3"></a>
## Version 3.6.3
<h3>Thursday, May 31st, 2018</h3>

**Security Release**

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* This release addresses the git vulnerability that was recently identified in [CVE-2018-11235](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11235).
* GitKraken Client is not susceptible to [CVE-2018-11233](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11233).

<a id="v3-6-2"></a>
## Version 3.6.2
<h3>Tuesday, May 29th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Hashtags are not just a commenting device: lesson learned.  Commit messages with a `#` will now only be commented out if the new comment option is enabled in your <kbd>Preferences > Commit Template</kbd> settings.  
* Discarding or resetting an untracked or renamed file will no longer throw an error, especially since the action completes successfully.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
* v3.6.2 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

***

<a id="v3-6-1"></a>
## Version 3.6.1
<h3>Tuesday, May 15th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* You may now disable spell check from <kbd>Preferences > UI Preferences</kbd>, and of course tell everyone about your spelling bee championship at Lincoln Elementary.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* If you installed the Linux `.deb` package recently, you may have noticed that GitKraken Client was not installed into your system path.  We fixed that by pointing Keif back to the proper location.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
* We popped the hood and made a change that allows for more memory allocatation when syncing with large LDAP environments.

## Version 3.6.0
<h3>Monday, April 30th, 2018</h3> 
 
<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'> 
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hUFtGJv_Zc" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> 
</div> 
 
<h3>Features </h3>

* Mission Control, we are a go for total pull request management!  Users can now do the following when creating a pull request through GitKraken Client: üöÄ
    * GitHub.com & GitHub Enterprise:
        * Add assignees
        * Add reviewers
        * Add labels
    * GitLab.com & GitLab Self-hosted:
        * Add an assignee
        * Add labels
* Is your pull request go for launch?  GitHub users: GitKraken Client will now display the status of pull requests in the left panel. Hovering over a pull request will provide a summary of information on a build‚Äôs status.
* Typos can be costly, so we‚Äôve added spell checking to the commit message box, pull request panel, and the commit template field.
* Quickly propel yourself into your repo folder from the new file menu option that allows you to open your repository folder in your default file manager. 
    * You can also use the keybind <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>. 
* Reduce the _drag_ on your graph by using the new context menu option to `Hide all tags`

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* Looking for more pull request info on the fly?  Tooltips for open pull requests have been redesigned and should be easier to read.‚ú®
* GitKraken Client will now display tag annotations.  Let everyone know how amazing your code is üîñ
* Selecting the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Connect to ...</span></button> button from the Clone window will now take users to the hosting service tab instead of the general authentication tab.  
* Switch repos at light speed!  <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + O</kbd> now opens the Fuzzy Finder with the open repo option preselected. 

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* You shouldn‚Äôt be faulted for writing a thorough commit message, so we resolved an issue that prevented users from accessing their submodules if the last commit message was very long.
* Amending a commit message using the commit keyboard shortcut should properly amend the commit instead of creating a new one.
* We managed to _fit_ this one in: long branch names will no longer go off of the Git Flow panel.
* [GitLab Self-Hosted] users: Initializing a public repository through GitKraken Client would actually make the repository private; this has now been fixed.  
* We‚Äôre all for resolving conflicts, especially ones that aren‚Äôt really there.  For repositories on FAT32 or NTFS drives, GitKraken Client should now correctly checkout the branch instead of throwing conflict errors.

*** 

<a id="v3-5-1"></a>
## Version 3.5.1
<h3>Thursday, April 5th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* GitKraken Client should now be able to connect to GitLab self-hosted servers with self-signed certificates, again. 

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.5.1 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

***

<a id="v3-5-0"></a>
## Version 3.5.0
<h3>Tuesday, March 27th, 2018</h3>

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUYuQh2UBE0" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3>Features</h3>
* Presto! Commit message D-N-A! You can now create commit message templates for each of your repositories. ü¶ñü¶ñ
    * For more information, [check out](/working-with-commits/commits#commit-templates) our commit template documentation.
* For those times when you can‚Äôt network eight connection machines and debug two million lines of code all on your own, GitKraken Client will now display co-authored commits!
    * [Learn](/working-with-commits/commits#committing-with-co-authors) how to format co-authors in your commit message!

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* Looking for that perfect iteration? We‚Äôve added a context menu option to copy a commit SHA.
* Buried repos should stay buried; so GitKraken Client will no longer display archived GitLab repositories in the clone window.
* Since you can‚Äôt discard and stage hunks when viewing the diff of an untracked, removed, or renamed file, we‚Äôve eliminated the temptation by removing those buttons.
* We consulted a mathematician and fixed the selection algorithm for unstaged/staged files, so it now respects Z-A sorting.
* _Must code faster, must code faster!_ GitKraken Client will now perform an LFS pull after a clone or submodule initialization, when necessary.
* You don‚Äôt always have to force reboot the system, but you might need to force push some commits. For VSTS users, force pushing to a branch when you do not have the force push permission enabled will now provide a more detailed error message.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* That is one big pile of commits. The squash option should now appear after rebasing commits.
* Life..._finds a way_... Just like Keif has found a way to fetch PRs from a repository that is in a nested group on GitLab.
* T-Rex is much shorter, but we realize you can‚Äôt always abbreviate. Profiles with long email addresses and names should no longer be cut off in the dropdown menu.
* Nuh-uh-uh, you didn‚Äôt say the magic word! The Repository Management window will no longer freeze up after removing an account from the initialize repository form. 
* WIP changes shouldn‚Äôt go extinct. Starting a new Gitflow branch would cause some WIP changes to vanish‚Äîthat should no longer happen.
* Commit selection shouldn‚Äôt have to be explained by chaos theory. So `Shift + click` between two commits should now select all commits in between the selection instead of randomly omitting a few.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.5.0 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

***

<a id="v3-4-1"></a>
## Version 3.4.1
<h3>Wednesday, March 14th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* GitKraken Client should no longer throw the following error when fetching pull requests from VSTS: `Fetching pull requests failed. A project name is required in order to reference a git repository by name.`

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.4.1 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

<a id="v3-4-0"></a>
## Version 3.4.0
<h3>Wednesday, March 7th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFF967DYANI" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3>Features</h3>
* From the depths, a magical window has opened! GitKraken Client now integrates with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)! üéâ
  - GitKraken **Pro feature** - [Upgrade now](https://app.gitkraken.com) to access!

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* We like to Add/Remove Programs, too, so GitKraken Client now supports Araxis and P4Merge as external diff/merge tools.
* For the hover explorers out there, a tooltip has been added to the green check mark in the left panel.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Integration help links will now send you to the correct support page instead of a 404 page...and it wasn‚Äôt even the [fun 404 page](https://www.gitkraken.com/giveme404); our apologies!
* Resolved an issue that prevented GitKraken Client from opening repositories that had a tag named `X`.  You probably _figured_ it was the ‚ÄòX‚Äô tag in your repo, _huh_?
* Toss those unwanted hunks out the window with confidence!  Discarding hunks on Windows will no longer add LF line endings to a file with CRLF endings.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
* **Beta Feature**: GitKraken Enterprise can now be configured to use LDAP as an alternative authentication method. üëè

<a id="v3-3-4"></a>
## Version 3.3.4
<h3>Monday, January 29th, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

 <img src='/img/documentation/getting-started/glo-soon.png' srcset='/img/documentation/getting-started/glo-soon@2x.png 2x' class='img-bordered'>

 You might see a shiny new menu button.  Only click it if you're ready to Glo!

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* When discarding a single file through the context menu, you‚Äôll now see a confirmation prompt: also known as the _ohnoididntmeantoclickthat_ prompt.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.3.4 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

***

<a id="v3-3-3"></a>
## Version 3.3.3
<h3>Monday, January 22nd, 2018</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Features</h3>
* Keif‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs resolution was to be less secretive. So, hovering over a repository in the breadcrumb menu will now display a tooltip with the repository‚Äôs full path.  üìÅ

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* After some year-end reflection, Keif decided that when staging or unstaging from a list of files, GitKraken Client will now select the next item in the list instead of selecting the first file in the list.  üéâ

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* The feedback and support forms should no longer feel laggy when writing in the subject field‚Ä¶ We do want your feedback, we promise!
* Scrolling through the Fuzzy Finder with your mouse wheel should now work as intended and not‚Äî_you know_‚Äîerase the results and act all weird.
* Making changes requires commit-ment, so we resolved an issue that prevented some users from entering a commit message after popping a stash.
* After staging, unstaging, or discarding all hunks and lines for a given file, GitKraken Client will no longer get stuck on a loading icon when trying to display the next diff.  New year, new kraken! _Keif will move on_.  üëè
* To make a change, you need to start from the beginning. So when editing a submodule‚Äôs URL, the cursor will no longer jump to the end of the URL.
* Wiki repos on GitLab are special.  We know this now, and GitKraken Client will no longer display a ‚ÄúFetching pull requests failed‚Äù toast when performing a fetch on a GitLab self-hosted Wiki repository.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.3.3 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

***

<a id="v3-3-2"></a>
## Version 3.3.2
<h3>Thursday, December 14th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Users running Git hooks on OSX High Sierra may now commit. We've figured out our commitment issues üíç

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.3.2 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.


***

<a id="v3-3-1"></a>
## Version 3.3.1
<h3>Wednesday, December 6th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Features</h3>
* Lost in a holidaze of commits?  There's now a Fuzzy Finder shortcut to view working directory changes.üîç

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* For our ambitious GitLab integration users with more than 100 repositories, you should now be able to see all repositories.üíØ
* `feature/cantremember`?  When creating a branch or tag, GitKraken Client will now leave the input field open if you navigate to a different window.    
* We removed some of the...grey areas _(sigh)_ by replacing the greyed-out placeholder text with actual placeholder text in the Clone and Init repository windows.
* We know everyone _loves_ a cryptic error message, but they are now more descriptive when trying to initialize a repository on GitLab Enterprise.  Sorry not sorry.

<h3>Bug Fixesüêõ</h3>
* We realized you need more than one character for a commit message, so GitKraken Client now allows users to write a full commit message after undoing a commit.
* When fetching from a GitLab repository, with merge requests disabled, an error message would appear saying it could not load your merge requests‚Ä¶ GitKraken Client now understands this is the same as informing someone that something divided by 1 is itself.  
* GitKraken Client will now properly cache group information for GitLab instead of constantly pestering the server about the same groups.

<h3>Notes</h3>
* Remotes on GitLab self-hosted accounts will now display the GitLab icon instead of the associated remote avatar.  Trust us, it's better this way.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
v3.3.1 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

</div>

<h3>Features</h3>
* GitKraken Client now integrates with GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition (Pro users only). üéâ

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* When renaming a branch, the current branch name will now pre-populate the input field.
* We‚Äôve added a context menu option to copy a file‚Äôs full path from the commit panel.
* Hovering over a user‚Äôs gravatar in the graph will now display a tooltip with that user‚Äôs name (or email if no name is provided).
* A loading icon has been added to the clone repository window; it displays while GitKraken Client is retrieving your remote repositories.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* New connections to GitHub Enterprise no longer require GitKraken Client to restart.
* Pull requests on GitHub.com with multiple assignees will now show all assignees in the tooltip and consistently **display in bold** when you are one of the assignees. (Previously, it would only bold if you were the first assignee.)
* Users will no longer be prevented from discarding changes for a removed file.
* In tree view, the commit panel should now properly display which files have been added/modified/removed/renamed while navigating through the graph.

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Features</h3>
* Got GitLab.com? Now you may create a pull request and add a remote from GitKraken Client.

**Bugfix Release**

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIaXCyYF400?rel=0&vq=hd1080' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3>Features</h3>

* If you have children, it‚Äôs usually a bad idea to have a favorite child. With GitKraken Client, it is totally fine to have a favorite repository, and thus we introduce you to the new Favorites list!
* Multi-select for discarding changes: like multi-select for Staging and Unstaging, but with Discard. üóëÔ∏è &nbsp; We‚Äôve added a context menu, too, so now you may discard all changes within a folder if you are in tree view. Brought to you by popular demand- we know how much you love multi-select!

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* We‚Äôve added a context menu option for updating submodules.
* Now use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>(Windows/Linux)/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>(Mac) or the Fuzzy Finder to open your configured external diff/merge tool.

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

* GitKraken Client no longer displays a `Pushed Successfully` message if a push fails due to a server hook. In other words, force-pushing to a protected branch will now display an error message instead of a false ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù message.
* We resolved an issue that would cause GitKraken Client to launch outside of your window region. _Sorry about that, it won‚Äôt happen again._ üíê
* Hitting the cancel button when trying to finish a Gitflow action (Hotfix, Release, or Feature) now properly closes the Gitflow window (instead of doing nothing).
* <kbd>Discard all</kbd> now discards submodule changes, too.
* GitKraken Client now correctly applies the operating system‚Äôs newline character when modifying a repository‚Äôs `.gitignore` file.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>

* v3.2 does not include any changes to GitKraken Enterprise other than those listed above.

<a id="v3-1-2"></a>
## Version 3.1.2
<h3>Monday, October 16th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Features</h3>

* Context menu option added: copy your selection when in File View. For those of you who cleverly tried to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>(Windows + Linux)/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>(Mac), you will no longer get line numbers when pasting the file contents. üëè

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* You can now initialize a repo with LFS and access the LFS configuration menu through the Fuzzy Finder.
* We‚Äôve added small loading icons when Staging/Unstaging a file.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>

* <kbd>Esc</kbd> will once again close the preference menu. üéâ
* Drag and drop actions, as well as selecting text in the output panel of the merge conflict editor, are now more accurate when zooming above or below 100%.
* So long useless error messages: staging a file directory change, an additional change to an untracked file, or a renamed file no longer throws a meaningless error message. üëãüèº
* Fixed an issue which prevented filemode changes from being discarded if the change was still unstaged.
* Resolved an issue that prevented changes from being committed to a submodule that had post-commit hooks.
* The Git Config Default setting for external merge and diff tools now works with tools whose absolute paths contain spaces. Welcome, space! üåå

<h3>Enterprise</h3>

From this release forward, any changes to GitKraken Enterprise will be noted here. v3.1.2 does not include any changes to GK Enterprise other than those listed above‚Ä¶ but stay tuned! üéÜ

## Version 3.1.1
<h3>Monday, October 9th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Fixed</h3>

* GitKraken Client CPU & memory sea monster harpooned. üåä
* Checkout and viewing a diff no longer results in GitKraken Client freezing.
* Discard hunk issue: now discards only the hunk, instead of the entire file. üòÇ

<a id="v3-1-0"></a>
## Version 3.1.0
<h3>Tuesday, October 3rd, 2017</h3>

Did you ever see such a beautiful GitKraken? Introducing Keiferella! Our bibbidi-bobbidi GUI!

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCt_bDlG2-U?rel=0&vq=hd1080' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3>Features</h3>

* We‚Äôve given the commit panel a Cinderella-style makeover! üë∏ It has a new header and can be pinned to the right or bottom of the window as you prefer.
 * The ‚ÄúDiscard All‚Äù button has been replaced with a trash can icon on the left  side of the new panel header. This should reduce the chance of accidentally clicking it when staging changes. <p align="center">üí´ _Wash the dishes, do the dusting, <br>
    Do the staging, make the commits! _ üí´</p>
 * When viewing a commit, the SHA for that commit is displayed in the new panel header (and copyable with a click).
 * When viewing the working directory, the new panel header will tell you how many files have been changed and display the name of the branch styled to match the label in the graph.
 * When in a conflicted state, messaging will now correctly reflect whether the state was the result of a rebase or a merge. The branches involved are now also styled to match their labels in the graph.
 * The list/tree view dropdown menu has been replaced with a new toggle button.
 * Quickly jump to your working directory when viewing older commits, with a new shortcut that appears at the top of the commit panel.
 * Now you can collapse the unstaged and staged files sections to make more room for viewing file changes in the commit panel.
 * A checkbox to view all files is now available when viewing a previous commit. This allows you to browse and view all files in a repository as they were at that commit.
* External diff tools are now supported. Set the tool you prefer to use for viewing diffs in Preferences > General.
* We added a context menu option to copy a branch‚Äôs name from the left panel or the graph.
* There‚Äôs now a full-file contents view when viewing a diff of a commit. Users are able to toggle between viewing solely the diff hunks with changes, or the entire file with the changes applied.

<h3>Improvements</h3>
This makeover came with new and improved easy-to-see scrollbars! üìú  
_But the thingamabob that does the job is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo_.

* Background colors and other styling has been improved for both light and dark themes wherever code is displayed (e.g., the new full file contents view, the diff view, file history view, and the conflict resolution tool). This should make code easier to read by improving text contrast and further differentiating code views from other panels in the application.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* Linux users, this one‚Äôs for you! Update buttons are much easier to see now.<br>
* Links to the EULA will now correctly take you to our EULA page (previously, it would do nothing‚Ä¶ whomp, whomp).
* Once upon a time, in Windows, GitKraken Client would occasionally crash when viewing a diff. Issue addressed.

***

<a id="v3-0-2"></a>
## Version 3.0.2
<h3>Wednesday, September 27th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Fixed</h3>

* GitKraken Client will correctly generate 2048-bit SSH keys (issue caused GitKraken to generate 1024-bit keys).
* Git hooks will no longer fail if the path they are on contains spaces.

***

<a id="v3-0-1"></a>
## Version 3.0.1
<h3>Monday, September 18th, 2017</h3>

**Bugfix Release**

<h3>Fixed</h3>

* GitKraken Client previously only supported Git LFS up to a file size limit of `250 MB/file`. The issue has been addressed and you may now use larger files (up to Git LFS's limit of `2 GB`).


***

<a id="v3-0-0"></a>
## Version 3.0.0

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5u6xrI6Lu4?rel=0&vq=hd1080' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3>Wednesday, September 6th, 2017</h3>

<youtube link>

Would you like some large files with that??

<h3>Features</h3>

* Super size those files: Git LFS support has arrived!  üéâ
* You can now select multiple files faster than going through the drive-thru! Simply use <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control/CMD</kbd> to multi-select files to perform any of the following actions:
  * Context menus
  * Stage
  * Unstage
  * Ignore

<h3>Improvements</h3>

* The right panel was looking a little beefy under the hood, so we slimmed it down a quarter pound and optimized the following:
  * File Tree view navigation with arrow keys
  * Scrolling through the file list

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

* Repository deletion should provide an error message if there is a file lock(s) preventing deletion.

<h3>Known Issue</h3>

* LFS file size limit: `250 MB/file`. Don't worry, we're on it!
