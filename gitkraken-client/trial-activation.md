### Add teammates to extend your trial

You may add users at any point during your 7 day trial to add 21 days to your trial period by clicking <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add teammates to extend my trial</button> button.

If you have already dismissed the prompt, you may access the option from your notifications <i class="fas fa-bell"></i> icon or by clicking the `TRIAL` flag in the bottom right of the UI.

The app will open a new window and prompt you for the name of the trial organization. You may change this name later from the organization's *Settings*.

After setting the name, add your user(s) by clicking the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add User</button> button.

Once you add user(s), you may dismiss the window. The app will automatically update with the new trial extension:

### Trial end

A trial organization will continue to exist after the trial period ends. However the organization will be marked `Expired` and any users that are part of the organization will lose access to the paid features.

When the trial ends, the *Owner* will be prompted to purchase licenses:

The trial organization may be converted to a paid account at any time by logging into [https://app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com) and navigating to <em class="context-menu">Organization  <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> [Your organization name] <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Subscription </em> and then <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Reactivate</button>. 

The Reactivate action will convert the trial organization to paid account with all the users previously added. There is no need to re-add users.
