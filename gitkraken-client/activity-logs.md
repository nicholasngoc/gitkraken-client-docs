Learn how to view all Git actions made to repositories and all application actions made in GitKraken Client through Activity Logs.

***

## Activity Logs 

Looking to increase your project scope?

Pop open the hood of your project and check out the <kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> located in the footer toolbar of GitKraken Client.

<kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> provide real time feedback of application and repository-level interactions that occured in GitKraken Client.

<kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> files are plain text in a standard log file format. Each line displays time of action, action feedback, and performance data measured in milliseconds.

<kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> collate Git actions, outputs information chronologically, and displays activity history indefinitely.

### Application Log

The *Applications* tab in <kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> contains messages about actions made in GitKraken Client application. Discover events from your GitKraken Client instance such as: project creation, clearing SSH, setting global gitconfig, etc.

This tab information remains consistent regardless of the repository currently in focus: switching repositories will not alter the Application system log files. 

### Repository Log 

The *Repository* tab in <kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> contains logged messages of Git operations taken while working with your repository. 

Refer to your *Repository* log to increase your project scope as a greater source of truth of your Git activity such as: fetch, push, merge, etc.

*Repository* activity reflects action taken in the repository currently open in focus. 

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> 
    For more verbose logging, navigate to <em>Preferences > General > Use extended logging in activity log</em>.
 </p>
</div>

Enabling extended logging provides even greater scope into repository-level Git actions, including Auto-fetch feedback.

### Git Hook Log

Do you automate your workflow with <a href= "/working-with-repositories/githooks/"> Git hooks</a>? 

<kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> log all hook activity - successes, warnings, failures, errors, etc.

The *Repository* tab populates a new tab in <kbd>Activity Logs</kbd> to provide active insight on feedback of your Git hook activity. View your error log in context to find how an event caused the change for faster troubleshooting.

You can also access a hook log from the snackbox notification that populates near the footer toolbar when an error is thrown.
