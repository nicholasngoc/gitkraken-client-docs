## Version 4.2.2<br>
<h3>Wednesday, February 6th, 2019</h3>

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* For those of you that didn‚Äôt appreciate Inception, we resolved an issue with duplicate repository names appearing in the breadcrumb list when a submodule had the same name as a recently opened repository.
* What good is a Blame button when there‚Äôs nobody to blame? The History and Blame buttons will now only appear for appropriate files.
* We all want to feel welcome, but Keif was getting a little carried away‚Ä¶ Now, when opening a repository from the CLI using the -p argument, GitKraken Client will open the repository instead of the welcome screen. 
* The History and Blame buttons will no longer throw the error: ‚ÄúFile path to get history is required.‚Äù
* The error message ‚ÄúGitUrlParse.default.stringify is not a function‚Äù will no longer appear when cloning or pushing from a TFS instance.

## Version 4.2.1<br>
<h3>Tuesday, January 22nd, 2019</h3>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* For the 1 percenters, GitKraken Client now ships with a .rpm option for easy installation on CentOS, RHEL, or Fedora.
* We nixed the 2 helpers who were sapping memory and system resources. You could call it, a clean bill of help üè•. 
* Yes, we got up on the wrong hide of the bed. The keyboard shortcut to open history view has now been changed to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to not interfere with the ‚ÄúHide‚Äù option on MacOS.


<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* Now you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes; the error message for creating a branch that conflicts with a branch directory is now clearly s-p-e-l-l-e-d-o-u-t-f-o-r-y-o-u.
* Windows users take a glass ü•Ç: the `Edit on Bitbucket Server` button should no longer take you to a 404 page. 
* <s>For users who prefer to compile their OS,</s> Linux users should now be able to open their terminal from GitKraken Client.
* When you truly need to ESCape a situation, the Fuzzy Finder and Repository Management modals will now correctly close with the ESC key if no repository is open.
* Nobody likes a blank image. Repositories under a private group on GitLab.com will have their avatars render as the GitLab logo instead of a blank image.
* We get it. You don't like Tetris. Fine. Diffs for rebased commits will no longer display out of order.
* It turns out, you do use this feature. Good to know: The `Open with GitKraken` context menu option on Windows should now open GitKraken Client instead of throwing an error message.
* The blame & history buttons will no longer appear for untracked files. We don't know why you're not tracking these files in a tool designed for tracking, but who are we to judge?

This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill: the story ends, you wake up at your computer with the same Git GUI you‚Äôve always had. You take the red pill: you stay in Wonderland, and I show you what it‚Äôs like to develop like a Kraken.

<h3>Features</h3>
* Keif swallowed the red pill and woke up in the construct with some new abilities.  Files can now be edited directly in GitKraken Client! The following features have also been added to file and diff views:
 * Syntax highlighting
 * Word diffing
 * Ability to search within a file (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> when focused)
 * And much more!
* D√©j√† vu or did something change?  File diffs can now be viewed inline or in Split view, in addition to Hunk view.
* Do not try and bend the file.  Realize the truth: there is no file.  You can now create and delete files from within GitKraken Client. 
 * These options can be accessed through the context menu or from the Fuzzy Finder.

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* There might not be an operator watching your back, so GitKraken‚Äôs support documentation is now accessible through the Help menu.
* Mastering the Fuzzy Finder can feel like becoming ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù.  The Fuzzy Finder can now be opened through the Help menu.
* _Free your mind_ from the graph clutter.  Stashes now have the ability to be hidden from the graph view.
* ‚ÄúAre you sure, Mr. Anderson?‚Äù  A confirmation prompt has been added when deleting a stash.
* _What if I told you_ there was an all new way to manage your repos?  Repositories can now be closed (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>), revealing a new view with quick links to open or start new projects.
* It doesn‚Äôt take a visit to the Oracle to know that you‚Äôre ready to commit. Now, after staging all files through the keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>), the commit message box will be focused automatically.
* Icons throughout GitKraken Client have been updated.

<h3>Bug Fixes üêõ</h3>
* A glitch in the Matrix, perhaps.  Private groups on GitLab CE and EE will now have their remote avatars display correctly.
* Like conquering a jump between buildings, GitLab projects with spaces in the name should not throw a `404` error after performing a pull or fetch in GitKraken Client. 
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre empty.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo are you.‚Äù  After merging a branch, GitKraken Client will now correctly set the commit message box to be empty.  
* The commit panel is now able to dodge the long name or path of a file and will no longer get pushed off of the screen.
* Commit Templates will now render correctly after staging and committing a file hunk.
* Resolved an issue that caused GitKraken Client to throw an error when trying to view a deleted file with a missing parent folder.  
* Sometimes history needs to repeat itself, so we resolved an issue that prevented users from copying more than 67 lines of a file.

<h3>Enterprise</h3>
* Fixed an issue with Start TLS for LDAP authentication.
* Resolved an issue that prevented users from registering through the Enterprise account site, when using built-in authentication.
