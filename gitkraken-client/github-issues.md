Note that required fields are denoted by `*`. Your new issue will automatically be added to your GitHub issues.

### Create Filters

You may create filters to view the issues you need. We use the same syntax that GitHub uses for thier issues.

<img src="/img/documentation/integrations/github-issues/new-filter.png" srcset="/img/documentation/integrations/github-issues/new-filter@2x.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

You can refer to [GitHub issue filtering](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) docs from GitHub for more information.

### Create Branches from Issue

You may create a branches tied to an issue from the issue details view <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Create a branch for this issue</button> button. You can also right-click the issue or click the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd>. 

<img src="/img/documentation/integrations/github-issues/create-branch.png" srcset="/img/documentation/integrations/github-issues/create-branch@2x.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

The branch name will automatically prefill based on the issue name. After the branch is created, these branches will be denoted with the GitHub icon to reflect its link to a GitHub issue.

From here, it should be possible to configure triggers on the GitHub side for changes made to this branch.

### Copy Issue link or View in GitHub

You can quickly navigate to the issue in GitHub from the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd> menu or by clicking <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the top right.
