## 1. Create an account
First, create a GitKraken account using your reseller email address by navigating to <a href="https://app.gitkraken.com/register" target="_blank">https://app.gitkraken.com/register</a>

- Do not use the GitHub option. Fill out the form instead. 

- Do not enter end-user information on the registration form. Resellers should register with their own email.

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
    <p>If you make GitKraken purchases for multiple customers and already have a GitKraken account, choose to <em>Sign into an existing account</em> and continue onto Step 2.

## 3. Enter Organization, Billing Details, and transfer ownership

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> GitKraken Pro <strong>only accepts credit card payment, PayPal, and bank order</strong>. <br> <br> However, invoicing is supported for GitKraken Enterprise. Contact our <a href="mailto:salesg@gitkraken.com">Sales</a><sales@gitkraken.com> team to learn more.
</p>
</div>

To complete purchase, input:

- `# of Users` : Number of licenses for the customer
- `Organization Name`: Organization of the customer 
- `Payment information` : Reseller billing details

Check <kbd>This purchase is for someone else</kbd> and fill out the email of the owner who you will transfer the account to. 

<img src="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/reseller-purchase.png" srcset="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/reseller-purchase@2x.png 2x" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Once the purchase is complete, you will be emailed a copy of your receipt.

The new owner will receive an email to accept the ownership transfer. They will have 7 days until this link expires. Until then you will remain on the account as the owner.

<img src="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/ownership-acceptance.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

After they accept ownership, their role will be set to <kbd>Owner</kbd> and your role will be set to <kbd>Admin</kbd>. If you wish to remain on the account but not consuume a license, you can edit your role to <kbd>Billing Contact (unlicensed)</kbd>.

## 4. Allocate license to customer 

To allocate the licenses to the customer, select the correct customer <strong>Organization</strong> from the left user panel and navigate to the <kbd>Users</kbd> tab.

- Click <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add User</button>
- Enter the customer contact email address
- Click <kbd>Assign Role</kbd> and then select `Admin`
- Click <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add User</button> again to finish 

<img src="/img/documentation/managing-organizations/buy/add-license.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

If the customer has requested the reseller allocate *all* of the end-user licenses, repeat the process listed above for each end-user email address with the <kbd>Assigned Role</kbd> as `User`.

User roles:
 
- `Owner`: All permissions granted. No one but the owner can remove the owner. After initial purchase, this role should belong to the customer.
- `Admin`: Can add or edit users and manage billing. Recommended for resellers and/or company purchasers.
- `User`: General user. 
- `Billing Contact (unlicensed)`: Does not consume a license. Has the ability to manage the organization's Settings and Subscription.

### User Instructions 

There are _no keys or license files_ to share with the users. Instead:

- Users that have been added to the subscription will receive an email invitation from GitKraken with relevant instructions. 
- Users will <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/download" target="_blank">download GitKraken</a> and use their credentials to log-in. 
- They will see Pro features and status once they log-in to the client with their email address from the subscription.
