GitKraken Pro is available for free to students through the GitHub Student Pack and to teachers through the GitHub Teacher Toolbox. If you don't have the pack or toolbox yet, first apply through GitHub:

[Get the GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

[Get the GitHub Teacher Toolbox](https://education.github.com/toolbox)

<div class='callout callout--warning'>

## Enabling Pro for Students or Teachers

Once GitHub has approved your pack or toolbox, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

To sign in again, launch GitKraken Client and navigate to <kbd>File    <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>     Sign into a Different Account <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>  Sign in with GitHub</kbd>

Or you may login by navigating to <em class='context-menu'> the profile dropdown</i>  <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign into a different account <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign in with GitHub</em>

When you sign in with GitHub, GitKraken Client will check whether your GitHub account has the pack or toolbox. If the app sees the pack or toolbox, you should see the `Pro` flag in the bottom right of the UI and you will be able to open private repos.

If you don't see `Pro` then this means GitKraken does not see a pack or toolbox with the email address tied to your GitHub account. This may mean you need to update the primary email address for your GitHub.com account.
